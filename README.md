# valuation
A Script for evaluating if a currency is over-valued or under-valued in relation to another.
## Usage
Ensure that you have a Python compiler installed on your computer. In the command prompt(cmd) type 
```python valuation.py```
## Example
So a 330ml bottle of Coca-Cola is €4.99 in Switzerland and K500 in Malawi. The current exchange rate is €1 = K1144.35.
```
C:\Code\valuation>python valuation.py
Domestic Currency Value of the Exchange Rate: 1144.35
Foreign Currency Value of the Exchange Rate: 1
Domestic Price of Commodity: 500
Foreign Price of Commodity: 4.99
Evaluation: The Foreign Currency is 1042% overvalued relative to the Domestic Currency.
Interpretation: This indicates a significant deviation from purchasing power parity.
Remedy: The domestic currency should be appreciated to bring the exchange rate back into equilibrium.
